**Data-Structure_HW1_1_Marble:**
Pat has `n` bags, each containing some marbles. He has `k` additional marbles that he hasn't put into the bags yet. He wants to add some of these marbles (possibly none) to the bags in such a way that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of marbles in the bags is maximized. Note that he does not want to move the marbles that are already in the bags. Since Pat lacks the intelligence to do this on his own, he has asked for your help. Can you assist him?

**Data-Structure_HW1_2_Palindrome:**
Popeye, who is very interested in strings, has recently read about palindrome strings. A string is a palindrome if it reads the same from both sides, such as "aba". He likes this property and wants to test it on various strings. To make the challenge more interesting, he wants to check if a string can be turned into a palindrome by adding exactly one character (any lowercase English letter) at any position in the string. Can you help him?

**Data-Structure_HW1_3_Palindrome:**
Asmonber wants to test his mental agility and intelligence by having an intelligence competition with Patrick. The first and only question of the competition is as follows:
Initially, we have an empty set of numbers. In each step, we have a request of one of the following forms:
1. `1 x`

   In this case, `x` is not in our set, and we need to add `x` to the set.

2. `2 x`

   For this request, we need to print how many numbers in the set are divisible by `x`.

The constraints are as follows:
- \(0 < x \leq 10^5\)
- \(0 < n \leq 10^5\)

Where `n` is the number of requests.
