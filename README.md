<h2>Homework 1</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Divisibility Queries</strong>: Add numbers to a set and count how many in the set are divisible by a given number. This requires efficient set handling and divisibility checks.</li>
  <li><strong>Max GCD with Marbles</strong>: Distribute additional marbles among bags to maximize the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of marbles in the bags.</li>
  <li><strong>Palindrome Insertion</strong>: Check if a string can become a palindrome by adding exactly one character at any position.</li>
  <li><strong>Max Function with Binary Representation</strong>: Maximize a function by using bit manipulation and binary representations to derive the highest possible function value.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Homework 2</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Defeating the Giant</strong>: Use soldiers to reduce the giant's strength, while each soldierâ€™s strength halves after every use, making this a greedy problem.</li>
  <li><strong>Range Maximum Query</strong>: Identify how many subarrays in a given array have a specific element as the maximum, which requires range query techniques like segment trees or binary indexed trees.</li>
  <li><strong>Card Shuffling</strong>: Shuffle cards using a random number generator with seeded randomness, adjusting card positions based on computed random values.</li>
  <li><strong>Infix to Prefix/Postfix Conversion</strong>: Convert between different expression formats using stack-based algorithms to handle operator precedence and parentheses.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Homework 3</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Well-formed Arrays</strong>: Rearrange an array to satisfy alternating conditions where even-indexed elements are smaller and odd-indexed elements are larger.</li>
  <li><strong>Tree Construction</strong>: Build a tree that satisfies both Binary Search Tree (BST) and min-heap properties by organizing nodes based on two different values.</li>
  <li><strong>City Fire Spread</strong>: Simulate the spread of fire across a grid using breadth-first search (BFS) to determine how long it takes for the entire grid to catch fire.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Homework 4</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tom and Grimalkin's Game</strong>: Perform a series of operations on a set, such as adding elements, checking existence, and counting how many elements are smaller than a given value.</li>
  <li><strong>Glove Recoloring</strong>: Optimize the number of gloves recolored to match color constraints over multiple days, requiring the management of color assignments and swaps.</li>
  <li><strong>Tree Switching</strong>: Traverse a tree and apply changes to match a desired goal state from an initial state using depth-first search (DFS) to minimize operations.</li>
</ul>
