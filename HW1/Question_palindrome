<h2>Palindrome Insertion</h2>

<h3>Problem Description</h3>

<p>Popeye, who is very interested in strings, has recently read about palindrome strings. A string is a palindrome if it reads the same from both sides, such as "aba". He likes this property and wants to test it on various strings. To make the challenge more interesting, he wants to check if a string can be turned into a palindrome by adding exactly one character (any lowercase English letter) at any position in the string. Can you help him?</p>

<h3>Input</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The first line contains an integer <code>q</code>, the number of strings.</li>
  <li>Each of the next <code>q</code> lines contains a string <code>s</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Constraints:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>1 ≤ q ≤ 10</code></li>
  <li><code>1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>For each string, if it is possible to make the string a palindrome by adding exactly one character, print "YES". Otherwise, print "NO".</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h4>Input</h4>
<pre><code>
2
aab
abc
</code></pre>

<h4>Output</h4>
<pre><code>
YES
NO
</code></pre>

<p>In this example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For the first string <code>aab</code>, you can add a 'b' at the beginning to make "baab", which is a palindrome.</li>
  <li>For the second string <code>abc</code>, it is not possible to make it a palindrome by adding just one character.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Input</h4>
<pre><code>
1
abcb
</code></pre>

<h4>Output</h4>
<pre><code>
YES
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, by adding an 'a' at the end, the string becomes "abcb" which is a palindrome.</p>
